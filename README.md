# Welcome to a Python introduction for Astrophysicists and Astronomers!

This repository is a set of Jupyter Notebook files introducing you to coding in Python, with examples geared towards modern astrophysics research. 

Before downloading this repository using the green Code button, please follow these steps to setup a Python instanceon your computer. If you already have Python and can read/edit Jupyter Notebooks, feel free to skip these steps and download the code!
